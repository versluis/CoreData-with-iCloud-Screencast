CoreData-with-iCloud-Screencast
===============================

iOS Project I'm building in a screencast about using Core Data with iCloud

In a nutshell, this is a standard Master/Detail template from Xcode 5.1, with added methods to make it work with iCloud. To run the code, make sure to change the Bundle ID and Team ID to match yours.

The screencast is for members only and has several parts, one of which is about iCloud and Core Data. Check it out here: http://pinkstone.co.uk/how-t-use-icloud-in-your-ios-apps/
